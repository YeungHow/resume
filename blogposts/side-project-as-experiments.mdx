title: "Treating side projects as experiments, not commitments."
summary: "Side projects became more valuable when I stopped forcing them to succeed and started using them to test ideas, assumptions, and myself."

For a long time, I treated every side project like it *had* to become something.

It had to be impressive.  
It had to be complete.  
It had to justify the time spent on it.

Most of them never made it past the halfway point.

### The problem with commitments

When a side project becomes a commitment, pressure sneaks in:

- “This needs to be production-ready.”
- “I can’t abandon this now.”
- “I should add more features before sharing it.”

Ironically, that pressure often kills momentum.  
What started as curiosity turns into obligation.

### Experiments change the rules

An experiment has a different goal.

An experiment asks:
- *What am I trying to learn?*
- *What assumption am I testing?*
- *What’s the smallest version that answers the question?*

Suddenly, success isn’t measured by polish — it’s measured by insight.

### Smaller scope, faster learning

When I reframed side projects as experiments:
- I scoped them aggressively small
- I stopped planning “phase two”
- I shipped faster and moved on without guilt

Some experiments failed quickly.  
Some surprised me and deserved further investment.

Both outcomes were wins.

### Experiments make quitting acceptable

One of the most underrated benefits: **permission to stop**.

If an experiment answers its question early, stopping isn’t failure — it’s efficiency.  
If it turns out boring or misaligned, walking away is a rational decision.

This mindset removed the shame I associated with unfinished projects.

### The side effect: better judgment

Over time, this approach improved my judgment:
- I got better at defining problems
- Better at estimating effort
- Better at recognizing what *wasn’t* worth building

Ironically, the projects I *did* continue ended up stronger — because they earned the commitment instead of demanding it upfront.

### Final thought

Side projects don’t need to become products.  
They don’t need users.  
They don’t need a roadmap.

Sometimes, they just need a question worth answering.

Treat them as experiments — and let learning, not obligation, decide what survives.
