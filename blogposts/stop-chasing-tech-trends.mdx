For a while, my learning strategy was simple:  
follow the trends.

New framework? Learn it.  
New stack? Bookmark it.  
New tool everyone’s talking about? Add it to the list.

It felt productive. It wasn’t.

### Trends move faster than understanding

Tech stacks evolve quickly — sometimes faster than meaningful mastery.

I realized I was collecting surface-level familiarity:
- Enough to build a demo
- Not enough to explain trade-offs
- Definitely not enough to debug deeply

Every new tool reset the learning curve.

### Fundamentals don’t expire

Eventually, a pattern became obvious.

Frameworks changed.  
Concepts didn’t.

The engineers I admired most weren’t impressive because they knew *everything*.  
They were impressive because they understood:
- How data flows
- Why systems fail
- Where complexity hides
- What to simplify first

Those skills transferred effortlessly across stacks.

### Depth beats novelty

When I shifted focus to fundamentals:
- JavaScript made more sense
- Performance issues became predictable
- Architecture discussions felt concrete instead of abstract

Learning slowed down — but understanding went deeper.

I stopped asking, *“What framework should I learn next?”*  
And started asking, *“What problem does this abstraction solve?”*

### Frameworks as tools, not identities

This shift also removed ego from my choices.

I no longer define myself by the stack I use.  
Frameworks became tools — interchangeable, contextual, temporary.

That made it easier to:
- Learn new stacks when needed
- Drop tools when they no longer served the problem
- Avoid being emotionally attached to technology

### The compounding effect

Fundamentals compound quietly.

They improve:
- Debugging speed
- Design decisions
- Communication with other engineers
- Confidence when facing unfamiliar systems

Trends spike attention.  
Fundamentals build leverage.

### Final thought

Chasing trends feels like progress.  
Chasing fundamentals *creates* progress.

Frameworks will keep changing — and that’s fine.  
If your foundation is strong, adapting becomes natural instead of stressful.
